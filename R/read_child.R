#' Read, render, and use a child document
#'
#' Read a child document, render it based on the file extension, which can be
#' .R, .Rmd, .md, or .tex, and place the resulting text into the main document.
#' Acts as a wrapper for [knitr::knit_child()].
#'
#' @details
#' The input file will be [knitr::knit()] quietly using internal code to set
#' `quiet = TRUE` to suppress the progress bar and messages output from
#' \pkg{knitr}. All R objects will be available in the global environment after
#' the file is rendered. That is, you will be able to inspect all R objects
#' that are created within `filein` after you attempt to render parent file.
#' This is helpful when you receive and error message or you just want to
#' investigate the structure or results of an object made during the process.
#' For example, if the child document includes the creation of a data frame
#' named `test`, then you could inspect the data frame after rendering the
#' document, e.g., `dim(test)`.
#'
#' Child documents are extremely helpful for when you want to share scripts or
#' text across multiple assessments documents, e.g., north and south area
#' models for a given species. In this situation, you could have two folders
#' that store the each store an individual assessment and a third folder that
#' stores text that is common to both documents. Then, you would call this
#' common text within each of the Introduction sections using
#' `read_child(file.path("..", "commonintro.Rmd"))` inside of an R chunk. See
#' the example section for more details.

#' [base::cat()] is used to print output to the screen if you run this function
#' on its own or to a resulting rendered file if called within an .Rmd file,
#' where the latter is more likely.

#' # See below for how to include this function in your .Rmd file.
#' # Note that the label for the R chunk (e.g., child_firstexample)
#' # needs to be unique, that is each time you copy and paste this code
#' # you must change the label to be a new value that is not used elsewhere.
#' # This example will look for a file called commonintro.Rmd inside a
#' # folder called common_text that is located just outside of your current
#' # directory.
#' #
#' # ```{r child_firstexample}
#' # read_child(filein = file.path("..", "common_text", "commonintro.Rmd"))
