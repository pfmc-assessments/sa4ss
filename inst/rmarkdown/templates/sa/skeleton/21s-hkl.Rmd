### \acrlong{s-hkl}

Since 2004, the \gls{nwfsc} has conducted an annual hook and line survey targeting shelf rockfish in the genus *Sebastes* at fixed stations (e.g., sites in the Southern California Bight. Key species of rockfish targeted by the \gls{s-hkl} are bocaccio (*S. paucispinis*), cowcod (*S. levis*), greenspotted (*S. chlorostictus*), and vermilion/sunset (*S. miniatus* and *S. crocotulus*) rockfishes, although a wide range of rockfish species have been observed by this survey. During each site visit, three deckhands simultaneously deploy five-hook sampling rigs (this is referred to as a single drop) for a maximum of five minutes per line but individual lines may be retrieved sooner at the angler's discretion (e.g., to avoid losing fish). Five drops are attempted at each site for a maximum possible catch of 75 fish per site per year (three anglers fishing with a line with five hooks across a total of five drops per site). Further details regarding the sample frame, site selection, and survey methodology are described in Harms et al. [-@harms_noaa_2008].

From 2004 through 2013, sampling was conducted only outside the \glspl{cca}. Beginning in 2014, 40 sites inside the \glspl{cca} were sampled, and roughly another 40 sites have been added in subsequent years inside the \glspl{cca}. It is important to note that some portions of the \glspl{cca} allow take for select species at depths less than 73 m. The survey currently has 201 sites (79 inside and 122 outside the \glspl{cca}). Additionally, there are 16 stations within the original sample design that have been converted into either state or federal \glspl{mpa} between 2007--2011 and continue to be sampled annually.
