### \acrlong{s-wcgbt}

The \gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random grid design; covering the coastal waters between 55 m and 1,280 m in depth [@bradburn_2003_2011]. This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two `passes' of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May and early October. Only two vessels were used in 2019 and three in 2013, with one of the three in 2019 unable to complete its pass due to a government shutdown. No survey occurred in 2020 due to \gls{covid}. The design incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to Canadian borders. Note that the Survey is not permitted to access the \glspl{cca} in Southern California.
