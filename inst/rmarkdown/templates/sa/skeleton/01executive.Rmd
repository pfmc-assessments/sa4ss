# Executive summary{-}

## Stock{-}

`r executive[["stock"]]`

## Catches{-}

Replace text with
trends and current levels.
Include Table for last 10 years.
Include Figure with long-term estimates.

## Data and assessment{-}

This assessment uses the stock assessment framework
Stock Synthesis 
```{r es-modelversion, echo=FALSE} 
if (exists("model")) {
  strsplit(model$SS_version,";")[[1]][1]
}
```
(SS3).

Replace text with
date of last assessment,
type of assessment model,
data available,
new information, and
information lacking.

## Stock biomass and dynamics{-}

Replace text with
trends and current levels relative to virgin or historic levels and
description of uncertainty.
Include Table for last 10 years.
Include Figure with long-term estimates.

## Recruitment{-}

Replace text with
trends and current levels relative to virgin or historic levels and
description of uncertainty.
Include Table for last 10 years.
Include Figure with long-term estimates.

## Exploitation status{-}

Replace text with
total catch divided by exploitable biomass or SPR harvest rate.
Include Table for last 10 years.
Include Figure with trend in f relative to target vs. trend in biomass relative to the target.

## Ecosystem considerations{-}

Replace text with
a summary of reviewed environmental and ecosystem factors that appear to be correlated with stock dynamics.
These may include variability in they physical environment, habitat, competitors, prey, or predators that directly or indirectly affects the stock's status, vital rates (growth, survival, productivity/recruitment) or range and distribution.
Note which, if any, ecosystem factors are used in the assessment and how (e.g., as background information, in data preparations, as data inputs, in decisions about model structure).

## Reference points{-}

Replace text with
management targets and definition of overfishing, including the harvest rate that brings the stock to equilibrium at $B_{40\%}$, i.e., the $B_{MSY}$ proxy and the equilibrium stock size that results from fishing at the default harvest rate, i.e., the $F_{MSY}$ proxy.
Include Table of estimated reference points for ssb, SPR, exploitation rate, and yield based on SSB proxy for MSY, SPR proxy for MSY, and estimated MSY values.

## Management performance{-}

Include Table of most recent 10 years of
catches in comparison with OFL, ABC, HG, and OY/ACL values,
overfishing levels,
actual catch and discard.
Include OFL (encountered), OFL (retained), and OFL (dead) if different due to discard and discard mortality.

## Unresolved problems and major uncertainties{-}

Replace text with
any special issues that complicate scientific assessment, questions about the best model scenario, etc.

## Decision table and projections{-}

Replace text with
projected yields (OFL, ABC, and ACL), spawning biomass, and stock depletion levels for each year.
OFL calculations should be based on the assumption that future catches equal ABCs and not OFLs.

## Scientific uncertainty{-}

Replace text with
the sigma value and the basis for its calculation.

## Research and data needs{-}

Replace text with
information gaps that seriously impede the stock assessment.
