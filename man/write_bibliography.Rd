\title{Write yaml header for bibliography to its own .Rmd file}
\usage{
write_bibliography(
  basedirectory = getwd(),
  up = 0,
  recursive = FALSE,
  fileout = "00bibliography.Rmd"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{basedirectory}{The directory that you want to look for bib files
in. If \code{up = 0}, then this will be the only directory that is searched.}

\item{up}{An integer value specifying how many directory levels you want to
search above \code{basedirectory}. The default is to only search the base
directory.}

\item{recursive}{A logical value specifying if each directory should be
searched for using recursion. The default is to not search recursively
because you could have other folders higher up that are not relevant.}

\item{fileout}{A file path for the file that will be saved to the disk.
Typically, full or relative paths are allowed.}
}
\value{
A yaml header for markdown either printed to a file or returned to the screen
if using \code{fileout = stdout()}.
}
\description{
Write the yaml header entry for bibliographies based on \code{.bib} files found
within the directory (\code{basedirectory}). Users can also search through
higher-level directories using \code{up} and lower-level directories using
\code{recursive}. This function is helpful when using bookdown because you will
often be sourcing files from multiple levels and have many bibliography
files, which can all be included in a single call within your yaml header. No
need to put all references into a single bib file or specify the bib files
ahead of time. Let us use R for this!
}
\details{
Within this package, note that this function is not currently called by any
other function, which is fine because each template has its own \code{.bib} file.
You can add \code{.bib} files later by running this function prior to compiling
your document. Or, you could add it to your index/skeleton.Rmd file using a
code chunk. For example, \code{write_bibliography(getwd(), up = 1)} would update
the yaml header every time that you compile, but be aware that you will have
to run \link[bookdown:render_book]{bookdown::render_book} multiple times to get get this to work.
Developers are working on using the code within the yaml to get it to work
instantaneously; so, stay tuned.
