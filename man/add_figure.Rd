\usage{
add_figure(
  filein,
  caption = "Add figure caption",
  alt_caption = "",
  label = "default",
  width = 100,
  height = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filein}{The path of the figure to be added (e.g., "C:\\My figure
directory\\plot.png").}

\item{caption}{A character string providing the figure caption that will be
added below the figure in the document. A default text string is provided,
but it is not informative and should be changed. Consider being more
verbose here than typical and remember that captions should be stand-a-lone
to ensure their portability between media.}

\item{alt_caption}{A character string providing alternative text for the
figure. The default is \code{""}, which will force the alternative text to be
blank. Using \code{NULL} will force the alternative text to also be blank;
previously, this option copied the caption to the alternative text, which
leads to the screen reader reading the same text twice. Note, that the
default is not ideal. Instead, alternative text that describes the
take-home message or information that is not available in the caption
should be included.}

\item{label}{A character string that will be used as the figure reference for
citation of figure in the document.}

\item{width}{A numeric value between 0 and 100 that dictates the figure width
in terms of percentage of size. The default is 100.}

\item{height}{A numeric value between 0 and 100 that dictates the figure
height in terms of percentage of size. The default is 100. Height does not
work in html mode. Use \code{width} to scale the figure up or down.}
}
\value{
Nothing is returned. Instead, \code{\link[=cat]{cat()}} is used to print output to the
screen if you run this function on its own or to a resulting rendered file if
called within an .Rmd file, where the latter is more likely. Results are
specific to the document being rendered, i.e., where
\code{\link[knitr:output_type]{knitr::is_html_output()}} is used to determine if your result is html or
latex.

Concatenate input regarding a specified figure with
the caption, alternative caption for accessibility, and
