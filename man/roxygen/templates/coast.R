#' @param coast A character string specifying which part of the coast the stock
#'   assessment includes. For example, `"U.S. West Coast"`, which is the
#'   default, will be used to create the following title: "Status of common
#'   name (latin name) along the U.S. West Coast in 2010". Previously, the word
#'   coast was added internally to the text, this is no longer the default
#'   behavior of sa4ss and instead you must explicitly add the word, which
#'   allows users to have more flexibility. For example, "California Coast from
#'   Point Conception north" is a viable option.
