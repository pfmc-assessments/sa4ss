\usage{
write_title(
  species,
  latin,
  coast,
  year = format(Sys.Date(), "\%Y"),
  fileout = "00title.Rmd"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{A vector of character strings providing species names for
all species included in the stock assessment. Typically, there will only
be one species, but this template can accommodate a species complex as well.
Each species should be capitalized as you would like to see it used in the middle
of a sentence. For example,
\code{"Pacific Hake"} is used in the stock assessment of hake;
not \code{"pacific hake"} because Pacific Hake is the preferred name, not
pacific hake. The text can be called in the document using spp for the
form to be used in the middle of a sentence and Spp when placed at the
beginning of a sentence.}

\item{latin}{A character string specifying the Latin name without
italic formatting. Please capitalize as you want it to be used in
the document though because case will not be altered.}

\item{coast}{A character string specifying which part of the coast
the stock assessment includes. For example, \code{"US West"}.
Do not include \code{"coast"} because it will be added internally.}

\item{year}{A numeric or character string specifying the year.
The default uses \code{Sys.Date()} to format the year into a four
digit character value.}

\item{fileout}{A file path for the file that will be saved to the disk.
Typically, full or relative paths are allowed.}
}
\description{
Write a file to the disk with the title
using the yaml form for inclusion in the stock assessment.
}
\details{
The Latin name as specified in \code{"latin"} argument
will be encased in underscores to facilitate it being italicized.
Using emph is not allowed because the tagging structure
for the creation of the 508 compliant pdf will not render the LaTex
code here. Nevertheless, the use of markdown inside the yaml seems
to work just fine.
